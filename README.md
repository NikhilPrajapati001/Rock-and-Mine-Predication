# Rock-and-Mine-Predication
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. The dataset consists of sonar reflections, where each instance is categorized based on whether the signal bounced off a rock or a mine.

Project Overview
Dataset: Sonar signals from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Objective: Binary classification to predict whether a sonar signal reflects from a rock or a mine.
Models Used: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest.
How to Run
Clone the repository.
Open the Sonar_rock_vs_mine_predication.ipynb notebook.
Follow the steps in the notebook to load data, preprocess, and train the models.
